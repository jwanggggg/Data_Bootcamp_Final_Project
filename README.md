# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Jonathan Wang here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
Project Description
In this project, I analyze what makes a player successful in the popular online game League of Legends. Factors such as objective score, kills, and damage dealt are varying degrees of important to victory, and I scrape data from different levels of play through Riot Games' API and analyze each of these factors. Terminology is fully explained and the analysis is comprehensible to a newcomer.
